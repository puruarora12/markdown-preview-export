# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### New Features

- **Mermaid Diagrams**: Fenced `mermaid` blocks render as diagrams in the enhanced preview, exported HTML, and PDF.

## [1.3.0](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nur-srijan.markdown-rich-preview&version=1.3.0) - 2026-06-30

### 🚀 New Features

- System Theme Auto-detection (for HTML Exports):

    - When you export to HTML, the page will now auto-detect the user's system preferences using standard CSS variables and media queries.
    - If the system is in Dark mode, the entire document (background, typography, code block container, and headers) will dynamically switch to a dark theme, and github-dark.min.css will be loaded.
    - If the system is in Light mode, it uses a clean GitHub-style light theme with light code blocks and github.min.css.
    - It dynamically listens for changes to the system theme (prefers-color-scheme), so it updates instantly if you switch your OS theme.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Reverted page-break-inside avoiding for code blocks to fix inconveniences for long code blocks.
- Fixed incorrect rendering of box-shadow as grey border.
- Fixed missing background after page break.
- Hid the copy-to-clipboard button (.copy-button { display: none !important; }) from exported PDFs
